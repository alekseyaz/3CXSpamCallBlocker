# 3CX Spam Call Blocker

The program interacts with the 3CX API and the Yandex.ru “Who called” service. Spam, if so, then blocks it.
When launched, the “BlacklistCategories.txt” file is created in the 3CX directory, which can be independently supplemented.
A log is being kept.

Uses API 3CX v3.0.0.0 (v16)
